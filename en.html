      <p class="intro__text">
        According to VTsIOM polls, 95% of Russians dream of going somewhere,
        but only 36% plan to spend their holidays in their home country.
        Like, what haven't we seen here at home? In fact, Russia is a whole
        universe with the gentle sea of the south, the dense forests of the
        Sayan Mountains and the harsh ice of the plateau Putorana. And you
        can also see all these beauties without millions on your account, a
        passport and many hours of flights. Like, for example, Faith
        Bashmakova is a brave young mother who took three children in her
        arms, sat them in her Lada and drove 20 thousand kilometers across
        her native country. We have selected and described some interesting
        places worthy of your vacation.

          water horizons — the calm Curonian Lagoon on one side and the
          rippling waves of the Baltic Sea on the other. A unique natural
          area on the edge of the Russian enclave.

            The Kaliningrad Region does not end there. For the traveler and
          explorer , there is the most the western point of Russia, the
          Baltic Spit, and the German heritage of placers of small seaside
          towns. The atmosphere of these places eliminates the hustle and
          bustle, plunging into the tranquility of nature and the smell of
          the steel, cool sea.

          remain under the snow of school memories of geography lessons.
          Perhaps you were not interested in the ultra-deep well
          penetrating the earth's crust, and apathy has been covering you
          for a long time. But your dream of seeing the Northern lights
          begins to come true with a ticket to Murmansk.

            Altai is one of the most beautiful places in Russia. First of
          all , because of the mountains: if you drive along the ridge,
          you will see slopes strewn with pine trees, mountain rivers and
          lakes. And if you open the windows in the car, you can get
          acquainted with the invisible miracle of these places — mountain
          air.
          </p>
          <p class="place__paragraph">
            The climate in Altai is temperate, so it's best to go here in
          summer. So you will see all the diversity of the local flora and
          fauna. Through the woods Moose roam the Altai, eagles fly over
          the ridges, and roe deer graze on the plains. And the famous
          manuls are also inhabitants of the Altai Territory.

            Everyone knows Baikal as the largest lake in the world. Many
          also know that this is the largest source of fresh water and one
          of the most beautiful places in Russia.
          </p>
          <p class="place__paragraph">
            Of course, this is all true. But Baikal is still an ideal place
          for skioring competitions. This is a kind of sport when a skier
          ties himself to a motorcycle, and the tandem tries to develop as
          much speed as possible on the ice. In March 2019 , a world
          record of 197.011 km/h was set at the Baikal Mile Festival.

            Siberia ends not in the Urals, but in Karelia: forming the taiga
          Siberian larch does not grow west of the Vodlozer. But here it
          reaches 30 meters — the forests of Karelian national parks have
          never known an axe because of impassable swamps. Some pines are
          already more than half a millennium old. Touch a living being
          who saw the sun before Ivan saw it Terrible. In the virgin
          forest, you will not find a trail for a hundred kilometers. And
          on rare paths, trees a couple of meters from the ground are
          marked with bear claws. So that everyone knows who is the boss
          here.
